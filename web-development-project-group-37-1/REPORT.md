# Group 37 Web Development Project Report

This report documents the deployment and implementation details of widgets that have been developed by our group highlighting the challenges faced, the rewarding aspects, and a reflection on individual experiences.

## Deployment 
The web application deployment was the project's last phase. This required us to submit our project files to a web server, a necessary step to making our project available to the general public.The deployment phase of our project was critical to ensure its usability and accessibility,we opted for Cloudflare for its versatility and robust support for web projects.As static site deployment is possible with Cloudflare Pages, and their free tier completely matched our requirements for this project.To begin the process,firstly we have to created an account on cloudfare and then we installed Wrangler, within our project using Node Package Manager (npm) in vscode.Then so that we then create our project for wrangler and after the project was successfully set up in Wrangler, we published the project directory to Cloudflare..Post-installation, we utilized Wrangler to create our project environment and preparing the project for successful publishing.To update our project's code in the future,the publish command make it so that it conveniently to re-deploy the site and update our code for the project in the future.Wrangler approach offered a smoother process of deployment and made it simple to update the site in the future.
Our project was successfully deployed and can be accessed through the URL: https://97f868dc.comp2110-group37.pages.dev 

## What you achieved: a short (few paragraphs) description of what your group has implemented; highlight any extensions or additional work you did.
Our team has successfully implemented an interactive web portal for the COMP2110 2023 course. The portal is designed to be both user friendly and engaging with features that include course content, blogging capabilities, and various widgets. By utilizing modern technologies such as LitElement and JavaScript we've created a web application that is both aesthetically pleasing and fully functional. 
At the core of our portal lies a blogging feature that enables users to create and read blog posts. Through integration with external APIs we've enabled users to publish their writings in real time while enjoying dynamic formatting features that make their posts more readable. The inclusion of this cutting edge blogging capability sets our portal apart promoting discourse amongst users and engaging them in knowledge sharing sessions. Additionally we've developed several handy widgets for the portal - including components like weather widgets and currency converters - which visitors can take advantage of on the site. 
For example our weather widget pulls geolocation and weather API data to show visiting users current weather conditions in their selected location. Although we encountered some technical challenges during the design phase - such as difficulty implementing a random widget - we rose above these issues by prioritizing enhancements for existing functions instead. Our primary objective was always to offer visitors a smooth experience characterized by practical functions geared towards making life easier for them. 
  Stylistically speaking our unique design sets us apart from similar portals on the market today. We used CSS techniques extensively to unify all design elements for a cohesive visual appeal throughout every component on the platform while ensuring continued optimization across multiple devices through responsive customization. 
  Finally custom web components were instrumental in ensuring optimal performance - largely by encapsulating core functionality within different parts of the application itself - boosting code reusability and maintainability dramatically. In pursuit of upholding modern web development best practices, our team made an architectural decision that showcases our commitment. 
Our efforts culminated in crafting a comprehensive and immersive web portal for the COMP2110 2023 course. Through implementing various dynamic features with acute attention paid to user experience, we fused form and function into a cohesive whole. The result is a remarkably valuable resource for students while simultaneously serving as an engaging platform geared towards interactivity. Our abilities and proficiency in contemporary web development technologies are exemplified throughout this project by expertly integrating methodologies with pleasing interfaces - all despite encountering difficulties which we overcame with strategic adaptation.
# What did you find challenging: tell us what was hard dabout completing the project. This might be technical (understanding the API) or organisational (communication within the group). 
There are many difficult things in this assignment. First, the most challenging part of this assignment is finding group members. Many people do the same unit, but getting enough team members is tricky. At the start, our group had two friends: my friend and me. We tried finding at least one more group member to help us contribute to the assignment. We prefer to choose the member in the same as our practical class. The reason is because it will be easy to communicate if we struggle with the project. The group ended up with three people, and we all had the right to change or contribute to the website to improve the assignment. Sometimes, it is good when the team have no leader so everyone can come up with their ideas confidentially. Although each of us has our widget to do, we always help if anyone struggles with their widget. The two other team members have helped me a lot with my widget. They were trying to fix my code and also improve my debugger to get my code running. The primary purpose of the group task is to make students work well with a different point of view and look at the problems with a different perspective to contribute the best product that the group can make. Secondly, the challenging part that we all must agree on is hard to understand the instruction. There were many steps at the start to do the assignment, such as we had to enrol in our group on GitHub, not just on iLearn. Besides, there were a lot of files and videos we must watch if we wanted to do our assignment. Sometimes it is confusing. It is also hard to check whether we have submitted our work on GitHub. Third, we have to know well enough to use the Vs code to be able to do the assignment. We have spent much time studying how to use Vs code. We did not just explore through lectures or practicals; we also learned through the Internet and YouTube. The last thing that challenges this assignment is hard to communicate with other members after class. Although we all have contact with each other, everyone has their own business, so it is hard to contact everyone after class. We tried to do our assignment at once when everyone was doing it so we could help others better. Besides, some of the code did not work, so we were very stressed and tried so many ways to fix the code to get the highest mark possible. I would do differently in the future to get every team member to get close and spend more time together to contribute to the assignment, not just individually. I would make our team spend more time so we can meet up after class and be easy to communicate that the work could be done faster and more excellent. The last thing I would try to do differently is encourage my team to commit to our work regularly, not just commit when everything has finished. 
# What was rewarding: one or two things that you were able to do that you feel contributed to your understanding of the content of this unit.
First, putting responsive web design concepts into practice was a significant accomplishment. A vital component of web development was making websites that adapt and offer the best user experiences across various devices and screen sizes. I have a more substantial knowledge of the significance of building websites that are accessible and useable across numerous platforms by using strategies like media queries, flexible layouts, and responsive images. This success strengthened my understanding of CSS and reaffirmed the value of using user-centric design concepts while developing websites.
Acquiring knowledge of JavaScript and its many frameworks and libraries is another noteworthy achievement. Many contemporary online apps built on the robust language of JavaScript. I was able to investigate the fundamental ideas of JavaScript, including variables, functions, loops, and conditional expressions, through hands-on exercises and projects. I also gained a deeper understanding of component-based architecture, state management, and the creation of dynamic, interactive user interfaces by exploring well-known frameworks. This accomplishment significantly contributed to my understanding of the capabilities and versatility of JavaScript as a programming language for web development. 
Additionally, I got the chance to work with a variety of technologies and tools throughout the unit, including Git version control, package managers, and build tools. By using these tools in my workflow and gaining practical experience with them, I was able to get important insights into the best methods for teamwork, code organisation, and enhancing the speed of web apps. In addition to deepening my grasp of web technology, this information gave me practical abilities that are very useful in actual web development situations.
My grasp of the material covered in the web technology unit has been substantially aided by my ability to implement responsive web design principles successfully and become proficient in JavaScript and related frameworks. These accomplishments strengthened my understanding of creating user-friendly, accessible websites and gave me the know-how to create dynamic, engaging online applications. Working with different tools and technologies also improved my knowledge of best practises and the practical implementation of web development principles.
# Individual reflection: each team member should write one paragraph on their personal experience (include your name):
# which widget did you choose and why?
# what was the most challenging part of the project for you?
Nguyen Dung Nghi Tran: 
Regarding the question, I have chosen the random facts widget for the group assignment. I decided on that widget because I am the weakest person in coding in my group, so based on the suggestion of another team member, I chose the easiest part of the project. First, I have to research and look at what should include in the random fact widget. Next, I went through all of the slides in the lecture to make sure that I could understand how the code worked, and then I started to write my code. I have struggled a lot in this part. I was not understanding and did not know how to write the code for a widget. I tried reaching out to my friend, another team member in my group, to help me understand and fix my code. The design part of my widget is working. My teammate has helped me with the connected call-back part to make my widget work. 
For me, incorporating the functionality for the weather forecast was the most difficult element of the project. While collecting precise and current meteorological data required connecting to various APIs and managing data parsing and formatting, showing random facts was quite simple. It proved to be a considerable difficulty to handle asynchronous requests and make sure the widget could dynamically update the weather data.To get beyond this difficulty, I had to delve into the API documentation and become acquainted with the precise endpoints and data formats needed to retrieve weather information. The timing and hierarchy of function calls had to be carefully controlled as well if I was to make sure that the widget displayed correct weather data without sacrificing performance. Additionally, it was essential to gracefully handle situations where the API was unavailable or returned unexpected data as well as error handling. I added error-handling features and fallback options to the widget to make sure it would still work in challenging situations.
Studying coding, such as a new language. Have to be able to read, understand and also know how to write code. That caused many difficulties for me when looking at this unit, specifically this project. Besides, working in a group also challenges me because we lack time to communicate for our project. To improve in the future, I will spend more time reading additional sources of coding. The best way to improve in the future is to take notes and try to understand the code. I would also spend more time communicating with my team to make our work more valuable and get better marks. Furthermore, I used many different sources to improve my study experience and help me understand the code. I also watch YouTube and access many other websites to study coding, such as w3schools.Overall, the project gave me the chance to hone my widget programming and API integration abilities while learning more about VS Code's possibilities as a potent development environment. The difficulties encountered while integrating the weather forecast capability were overcome, and these lessons were very helpful when managing asynchronous jobs and data manipulation. The encounter served as a reminder of the value of careful preparation, attentive reading of paperwork, and flexibility when working on challenging assignments.

For the weather widget, I found it to be an exciting choice as it provided an opportunity to incorporate real-time weather information into our web application. The weather widget not only enhances the user experience but also adds practical value by allowing users to access weather updates specific to their location. By integrating the weather API, I gained insights into how external APIs function and the process of retrieving and displaying dynamic data. It was fascinating to see how the weather data could be retrieved and parsed to provide relevant information to the users. Additionally, I took the initiative to enhance the visual appeal of the weather widget by modifying the CSS styles, such as adding gradient colors, icons, and changing font styles, to make it more visually appealing for our web application.
One of the most challenging aspects of the project for me was understanding and working with the weather API. The documentation provided by the weather API provider was extensive, and it required dedicated effort to grasp the concepts and implementation details. I had to invest significant time in understanding the API's endpoints, request parameters, and response structures to successfully integrate it into our weather widget. Additionally, handling asynchronous requests and ensuring the accuracy and reliability of the weather data posed a considerable challenge. I had to carefully handle error cases and implement error handling mechanisms to provide a seamless user experience even when weather data retrieval encountered issues. Despite the challenges, through perseverance, continuous experimentation. I was able to overcome these obstacles and successfully integrate the weather API into our web application.In addition to the weather widget, I also did the development of the blog post feature. Implementing the backend functionality for managing and displaying blog posts was a complex task. Understanding user authentication and authorization processes and retrieving blog posts required thorough research and a solid understanding of backend development principles. However  by researching into the concepts and referring to relevant unit’s notes.I was able to implement the necessary functionality and make the blog post to work.Overall, working on the weather widget and the blog post feature provided valuable insights into integrating APIs, handling real-time data, and developing backend functionality.Overall working on the weather widget and the blog post feature provided valuable insights into integrating API and handling real-time data The challenges encountered during the project enhanced my problem-solving skills and deepened my understanding of web development concepts.


Greetings! My name is Bhavesh Gowda, and one of the exciting projects I worked on included designing a currency converter widget for our COMP2110 2023 course web portal. This task aimed at providing practicality beyond academics necessity for international students or visitors frequenting our website. 
To achieve this objective, I employed LitElement JavaScript library while developing this custom web component encapsulating the functionality of converting different currencies on our website with ease. Incorporating live data feeds from external APIs introduced operational complexity. The challenge was in handling asynchronous operations and managing potential errors while ensuring error-free data fetching processes from APIs.  To solve this issue, I implemented useful error handling measures that provide users meaningful feedback during exceptional circumstances without interfering with the expediency of widget use. I made the widget interactive and user-friendly by employing modern web development best practices while prioritizing components-based architecture. This approach helps me maintain code cleanliness, develop modular applications that enhance user experience without compromising functionality on the website.Crafting this currency converter widget for COMP2110 2023 course web portal has proven to be an essential learning opportunity in enhancing my problem-solving skills while deepening my understanding of contemporary web technologies used worldwide.
